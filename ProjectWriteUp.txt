The project features a simulated world (the cube) in space. The player takes the role of a god affecting the properties of the world through the
manipulation of sensors. The sensors we have working in this prototype are light, heat, and touch. Sensors are modified through interaction with
the Arduino and the data is passed to Unity using Ardity.Each one of these affects persistent effects on the world, while also having thresholds
that can combine for unique effects.
